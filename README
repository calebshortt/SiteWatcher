SiteWatcher
================================================================================================
SiteWatcher is a simple program that takes a list of websites (stored in sites.txt)
and monitors each site for changes. If a change occurs on a monitored site,
SiteWatcher will email the configured address with the site that has changed.

================================================================================================

================================================================================================
Python 3.6.x
A valid gmail address
A valid App password for the gmail address above (for SiteWatcher to use to send email)

1. There is an example sites.txt file to use as a reference.

3. There should be no third-party requirements for this program (no need to install anything other than Python)
